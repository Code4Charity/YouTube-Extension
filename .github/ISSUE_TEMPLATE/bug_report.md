## 1. Bug Report:
 - **BUG**:                   <!--(clear/concise description or Screenshot or Video) -->
   -  Browser:                <!-- especially if not Chrome but Firefox / Safari / ...] -->
   -  **HOW**:               <!-- Steps to **reproduce**. (Might only happen with your settings?) -->
 - Did YouTube change?
   - *Or* did our last update start the bug?  Then Are any Browser errors shown? `F12`-key : `console`)   
 - Does the bug not happen when you log out of YouTube?  Then please copy your experiment flags list with & without the error, so we can compare: Enter:  ´yt.config_.EXPERIMENT_FLAGS´ into the Browser console on youtube (F12-Key). (can also copy them from the html source(ctrl+U))
  
### STEP-0:  (before submitting)  
Thanks for coming & caring! Sometime 3 words are enough of a bug report. But please check if the issue has already been reported ever.  That might inspire you to post different words there.  
(With [GitHub's issue search (use this link)](https://github.com/ImprovedTube/ImprovedTube/issues?q=) (else removing "is:issue is:open" from the standard search)  
<!-- ( If it was posted before, you can answer/react there to give it your voice and move it up in the lists) 
         If the status is  "closed" (=fixed) recently, then Web Stores can be updated soon)
         If  it was closed month or years ago, then it might reappeared & must be fixed again.) -->
